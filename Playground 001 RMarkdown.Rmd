# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for 
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown
see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

# Part 1
Here, we are going to test some basic functionalities. We can have headers in 
multiple levels and sizes. These headers can also be used as segmentation tool.

### Part 1.1) Italic & Bold
We can also have *italic* and **bold** texts.

### Part 1.2) Unordered List
We can have bulleted lists like:

* Item 1
  * Item 1.1
    * Item 1.1.1
* Item 2
  * Item 2.1
    * item 2.1.1
    
### Part 1.3) Ordered List
We can also have ordered lists like:

1. Item 1
   a. Item 1.a
   b. Item 1.b
2. Item 2
   a. Item 2.a
   b. Item 2.b
   
### Part 1.4) Tables
We can also create simple and complex tables

First Header | Second Header | Third Header
-|-|-
Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Cell 7 |
Cell 3 | Cell 4
Cell 5 | Cell 6

This is another table that we can use with code:

```{r mtcars_table, echo=FALSE}
kable(mtcars)
```

### Part 1.5) Equations
We can also write some nice equations

$$ y = x\beta + \varepsilon $$

We can also use inline questions like: $\hat{\beta} = (x ^ {T} x)^{-1} x^{t} y$

### Part 1.6) Code Chunks

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes 
both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the 
document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```
---
```{r mtcars, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
map_df(mtcars, mean)
```

We can also use inline codes like: The mean of column "mpg" in databse "mtcars"
is `r mean(mtcars$mpg)` . In addition, we can highlight code inline like: 
The mean can be calculated by using the code: `mean()` .

### Part 1.7) Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent 
printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#### Part 1 - Example 1
We use data on `r nrow(mtcars)` cars featured in the magazine **Motor Trend** in 
1974. This it what the data look like:
```{r echo = FALSE} 
kable(mtcars)
```

#### Part 1 - Example 2: Miles per gallon vs weight

Now we look at how fuel consumption is related to weight.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl), size = qsec)) +
  geom_point()
```

#### Part 1 - Example 3: AI Leadership search trend

```{r AI Leadership, echo=FALSE}
#' Apparently, a code t oget trends. The library is included in library section.
# gtrends(c("AI Leadership"),
  # time = "all"
# )
```
